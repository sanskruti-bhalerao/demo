  <h1>Database Management System</h1>  
  <h2>Structure of Database Management System</h2>
 
<p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that allows users to define, store, maintain, and manage data in a structured and efficient manner. It acts as an intermediary between data and users, allowing disparate data from different applications to be managed. A DBMS simplifies the complexity of data processing by providing tools to organize data, ensure its integrity, and prevent unauthorized access or loss of data.
    In today's data-driven world, DBMS are essential for applications such as banking systems, e-commerce platforms, education, and medical systems. They not only store and manage large amounts of data, but also provide functionality that provides performance, security, and scalability for multiple users with multiple access levels.
</p>
<h2><mark>Understanding Data Theft in DBMS</mark></h2>
<p><b>Hacking and exploiting:</b> Attackers can use DBMS security gaps to access unauthorized sensitive data.</p>
<p><b>Insider threats:</b> Employees or contractors compromise privileged access to information.</p>
<p><b>Phishing and social engineering:</b> These are techniques that will trick the authorized user into revealing the login credentials to enable intrusion.
Malware and ransomware attacks: These are malware that make database security vulnerable to attack, thus giving access to attackers to steal data or lock down data until some amount of ransom is paid.
Data theft prevention is not only an issue in sensitive information matters but also for building trust between businesses and clients. Controls over access, periodic audits, real-time monitoring of activities done through the database are effective measures one could consider to reduce the risk. Also, following cyber security protocols and periodic inundation of database systems will reduce most of the vulnerabilities.</p>

<h4><u>What is ER diagram</u></h4>
<p>ER Diagram is known as Entity-Relationship Diagram, it is used to analyze  the structure of the Database.</p><p> It shows relationships between entities and their attributes.</p><p> An ER Model provides a means of communication. </p>
